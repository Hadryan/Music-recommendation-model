# music-recommendation-model

It is a very basic implementation of machine learning. I use very basic data set for this model. I apply decision tree algorithm by using scikit-learn library.  
  
This project describes:  
1-How to import and clean data set for machine learning purpose.  
2-How to build model.  
3-Model's predictions.  
4-How to calculate model's accuracy.  
5-Visualization of model/algorithm.  
  
Purpose:  
The main purpose to create this project was to understand the basic workflow of machine learning. And to learn about the problems, which we can solve with machine learning and make our softwares better for this world.  
  
P.S. It is a perfect project for beginners, who want to start their career in machine learning or data science. Once you understand the basic workflow of anything, then you can do anything. So just download the zip file and understand code, as I write very crystal clear code, which you can understand easily.
